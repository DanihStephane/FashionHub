CyberDev

Design a futuristic, hyper-realistic personal developer portfolio website. The website must look ultra modern and high-end, with interactive 3D animations (using WebGL or Three.js), smooth microinteractions, and immersive transitions. Include animated background particles, dynamic lighting effects, parallax scrolling, and realistic physics-based hover effects. The color palette should be sleek and elegant — think dark mode with neon accents (electric blue, cyberpunk purple, vibrant cyan). Add a 3D animated avatar of the developer, floating interface elements, and real-time responsive UI components. The homepage should instantly capture attention with a cinematic hero section, dynamic typing text, and animated code snippets. Every section (About, Projects, Skills, Contact) should feel alive and reactive. Add ambient background sound effects for immersion. The design must showcase excellence, creativity, and tech mastery — like a portfolio that could land a job at Google or SpaceX. Responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Must be persuasive, professional, and visually unforgettable.

Add more 3D objects to the scene, such as technology logos (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.) that float with smooth, interactive animations. Customize particles to make them more original and stylish, avoiding overly basic effects. For example, transform them into lightning, flames, or other dynamic and stylized shapes to add a unique, immersive, and spectacular touch to the final rendering.
